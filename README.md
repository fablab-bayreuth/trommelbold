The 2016 Trommelbold workshop at Fablab Bayreuth

http://wiki.fablab-bayreuth.de/projekte:fabclap

The trommelbold is an Arduino controlled drum machine, that powers up to eight
solenoid channels with attached drum sticks or other noise-generating equipment.
Rythm sequences can be stored directly in the microcontroller firmware, or
controlled remotely via MIDI and/or USB.
